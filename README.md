# Author: Paul Keller

# This project utitlizes early SQL skills such as table creations, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and uses of both primary & foreign keys. First, I created the six tables based on the data provided. Next, I imported the data through the import function. I chose the order of the tables importation based on the ERD that I created. After creating the tables, I set to work solving the eight objectives of the data analysis requirement. I have the ERD schema and the code to create the tables and retreive the data included in this repository.
